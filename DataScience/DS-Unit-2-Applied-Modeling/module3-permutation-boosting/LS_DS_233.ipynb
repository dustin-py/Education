    ">**When the dataset has two (or more) correlated features, then from the point of view of the model, any of these correlated features can be used as the predictor, with no concrete preference of one over the others.** But once one of them is used, the importance of others is significantly reduced since effectively the impurity they can remove is already removed by the first feature. As a consequence, they will have a lower reported importance. This is not an issue when we want to use feature selection to reduce overfitting, since it makes sense to remove features that are mostly duplicated by other features. But when interpreting the data, it can lead to the incorrect conclusion that one of the variables is a strong predictor while the others in the same group are unimportant, while actually they are very close in terms of their relationship with the response variable. — [Selecting good features – Part III: random forests](https://blog.datadive.net/selecting-good-features-part-iii-random-forests/) \n",
