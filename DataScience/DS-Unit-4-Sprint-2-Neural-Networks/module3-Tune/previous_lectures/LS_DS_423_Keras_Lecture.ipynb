    "# Lets Use Libraries!\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the last two days has been to familiarize you with the fundamentals of neural networks: terminology, structure of networks, forward propagation, error/cost functions, backpropagation, epochs, and gradient descent. We have tried to reinforce these topics by requiring to you code some of the simplest neural networks by hand including Perceptrons (single node neural networks) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons also known as Feed-Forward Neural Networks. Continuing to do things by hand would not be the best use of our limited time. You're ready to graduate from doing things by hand and start using some powerful libraries to build cutting-edge predictive models. "

    "> \"Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:\n",

    "Google Colab does not have the latest Tensorflow 2.0 installation, so you'll need to upgrade to that if you want to experiment with it. However Tensorflow 2.0 was just released last month and is still in \"alpha\" so if you **really** want to use the latest and greatest be prepared for odd bugs that you don't have control over every once in a while. <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/>"

There are problems with this but the biggest problems again lie in backpropagation. The derivative of any linear function is a horizontal line which would indicate that we should update all weights by a constant amount every time -which on balance wouldn't change the behavior of our network. Linear functions are typically only used for very simple tasks where interpretability is important, but if interpretability is your highest priority, you probably shouldn't be using neural networks in the first place."

I mean, this is why we use it as the squishifier in logistic regression as well. It constrains output, but over repeated epochs pushes predictions towards a strong binary prediction. \n",

    "What's the biggest problem with the sigmoid function? The fact that its slope gets pretty flat so quickly after its departure from zero. This means that updating weights based on its gradient really diminishes the size of our weight updates as our model gets more confident about its classifications. This is why even after so many iterations with our test score example we couldn't reach the levels of fit that our gradient descent based model could reach in just a few epochs."

The Tanh function can actually be created by scaling the sigmoid function by 2 in the y dimension and subtracting 1 from all values. It has basically the same properties as the sigmoid, still struggles from diminishingly flat gradients as we move away from 0, but its derivative is higher around 0 causing weights to move to the extremes a little faster.

    "ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Units it is by far the most commonly used activation function in modern neural networks. It doesn't activate neurons that are being passed a negative signal and passes on positive signals. Think about why this might be useful. Remember how a lot of our initial weights got set to negative numbers by chance? This would have dealt with those negative weights a lot faster than the sigmoid function updating. What does the derivative of this function look like? It looks like the step function! This means that not all neurons are activated. With sigmoid basically all of our neurons are passing some amount of signal even if it's small making it hard for the network to differentiate important and less important connections. ReLU turns off a portion of our less important neurons which decreases computational load, but also helps the network learn what the most important connections are faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's the problem with relu? Well the left half of its derivative function shows that for neurons that are initialized with weights that cause them to have no activation, our gradient will not update those neuron's weights, this can lead to dead neurons that never fire and whose weights never get updated. We would probably want to update the weights of neurons that didn't fire even if it's just by a little bit in case we got unlucky with our initial weights and want to give those neurons a chance of turning back on in the future."
