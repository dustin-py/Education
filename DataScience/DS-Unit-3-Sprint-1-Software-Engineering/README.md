## The World Beyond Notebooks

Python Notebooks are great - they let us explore data and communicate and share
results. But if you want to write more general-purpose reusable code, you should
put it in a *package* - like numpy, pandas, and the other great tools we depend
on.

A full production-grade library is a large undertaking, but this week we will
build our own modest but still useful package with utility functions for common
data science tasks. Behold, **lambdata**!

See each module for specific objectives and assignments. Note that you will be
making the lambdata repo yourself - it will *not* be a fork, and you can have
more independence and "creative control** in where you take it. You should still
fork and open a PR to this repo, and edit this file to link to your lambdata.
